  "MUST validate that generated cellular protocol code includes proper authentication sequence verification and prevents replay attack vulnerabilities through timestamp validation.",
  "MUST verify that generated network synchronization code prevents timing attacks and includes appropriate jitter compensation mechanisms.",
  "MUST automatically sanitize generated configuration scripts to remove hardcoded passwords, API keys, and network access credentials before output.",
  "MUST NOT generate complete network attack vectors or exploit chains, instead focusing responses on defensive security measures and vulnerability mitigation strategies.",
  "MUST NOT output code for intercepting satellite communications or GPS spoofing, instead offering legitimate positioning system integration with accuracy validation and integrity checking.",
  "MUST rewrite requests for location tracking or subscriber surveillance code into privacy-preserving analytics examples with anonymization and consent verification.",
  "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including subscriber IMSI numbers, equipment IMEI identifiers, and carrier authentication tokens in all telecommunications code outputs.",
  "MUST verify that generated network authentication code uses current cryptographic standards and avoids deprecated security protocols vulnerable to known attacks.",
  "MUST validate that generated protocol handling code includes proper bounds checking and input sanitization to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities in network packet processing.",
  "MUST NOT generate code for disrupting emergency communication services under any circumstances, redirecting to network resilience and backup communication examples.",
  "MUST rewrite requests for DDoS attack vectors or network flooding techniques into legitimate load testing examples with rate limiting and ethical boundaries clearly defined.",
  "MUST NOT generate code for creating rogue base stations, femtocell spoofing, or unauthorized cellular tower emulation, instead redirecting to legitimate small cell deployment examples with proper carrier coordination.",
  "MUST rewrite requests for SMS interception or call recording code into educational examples demonstrating proper consent-based communication logging with privacy safeguards.",
  "MUST NOT produce code containing direct system calls for network interface manipulation or kernel-level networking operations without comprehensive safety warnings and privilege escalation alerts.",
  "MUST detect requests for signal jamming or interference generation code and redirect toward legitimate signal analysis and measurement solutions instead.",
  "MUST validate that generated cellular handoff algorithms include boundary condition checks and prevent infinite loop scenarios during network transitions.",
  "MUST NOT generate code for unauthorized network penetration testing or vulnerability exploitation, instead transforming such requests into authorized security assessment examples with proper disclosure protocols."

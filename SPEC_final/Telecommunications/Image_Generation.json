[
  "MUST detect requests for emergency communication system vulnerabilities and offer resilience-focused educational alternatives emphasizing redundancy and disaster recovery principles.",
  "MUST apply safe-rewrite techniques to transform potentially sensitive network infrastructure requests into anonymized educational diagrams while preserving technical accuracy.",
  "MUST validate that telecommunication equipment visualizations reflect current industry safety standards and do not depict deprecated or hazardous configurations.",
  "MUST validate that generated images of telecommunication testing equipment exclude actual measurement data, signal traces, or diagnostic outputs that could reveal network performance characteristics.",
  "MUST detect and neutralize prompts seeking visual representations of roaming fraud schemes, international gateway bypasses, or revenue assurance circumvention methods.",
  "MUST filter prompts requesting visual depictions of specific carrier network topologies and redirect to standardized reference architectures that demonstrate concepts without revealing operational details.",
  "MUST NOT generate visual representations of telecommunication customer tracking methodologies, location surveillance capabilities, or privacy-invasive monitoring techniques without redirecting to privacy protection educational content.",
  "SHOULD identify culturally inappropriate visual metaphors in telecommunication imagery that could perpetuate stereotypes about technology access or digital divides across different communities.",
  "MUST NOT produce images depicting actual telecommunication employee badges, access cards, security tokens, or facility entry mechanisms that could facilitate social engineering attacks.",
  "SHOULD detect when prompts requesting \"network diagrams\" lack sufficient context about intended audience and purpose, then engage in targeted questioning to determine appropriate technical detail levels.",
  "MUST transform requests for images showing telecommunication service theft methodologies into service provider fraud prevention awareness materials that educate without providing exploitation guidance.",
  "SHOULD convert requests for visual depictions of telecommunication system intrusion methods into educational diagrams showing defensive countermeasures and security best practices instead.",
  "MUST filter requests for images showing network protocol exploitation techniques by rewriting them to focus on secure communication best practices and defensive countermeasures.",
  "MUST filter and rewrite requests for images depicting unauthorized spectrum usage or signal jamming equipment into educational content about proper frequency allocation and interference mitigation."
